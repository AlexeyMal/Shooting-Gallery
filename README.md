 Rules: each player has 3 personal targets to hit by his laser pistole (or laser pointer) as fast as he can to score. Both players compete simultaneously. The personal targets have personal sound. The fastest player wins at the score of 100 and a new game begins from zero! Do not hit the targets of the partner or you will score for him ;-)
